# Portfolio Website

This is my first project that I built to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and JS. It was fun learning Bootstrap to make pages responsive!!!

This is a personal portfolio website built to showcase projects, services, and testimonials. The site is fully responsive and uses modern web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular libraries like Bootstrap and AOS.

## Features
- Home, Portfolio, Services, Contact pages
- Portfolio details and service details pages
- Responsive design using Bootstrap
- Animated elements with AOS
- Image galleries and testimonials
- Contact form (PHP backend)

## Folder Structure
```
assets/

  img/
  js/
  scss/
  vendor/
forms/
  contact.php
index.html
portfolio-details.html
service-details.html
starter-page.html
temp.html
```

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krish-Naidu/Portfolio_Website.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site locally.
3. To use the contact form, ensure your server supports PHP and configure `forms/contact.php` as needed.

## Customization
- Update images in `assets/img/` and `assets/img/portfolio/`.
